Hi, I'm Leonardo Melchiori and I'm a passionate, self-directed FullStack developer. I love working on challenging projects that require innovative and creative solutions.

I have experience developing web applications using technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and MongoDB. Furthermore, I am constantly learning and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills in the field of web development.

On my GitHub profile, you'll find a variety of projects I've worked on that used FullStack technologies. These projects are a showcase of my experience and skills in web development and creating functional and interactive websites and applications.

Feel free to explore my GitHub profile and review the projects I've developed. If you have any questions or are interested in collaborating on a project, do not hesitate to contact me.

Thanks for visiting my GitHub profile. I hope to have the opportunity to collaborate with you soon!
